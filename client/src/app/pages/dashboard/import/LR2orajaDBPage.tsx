				should set up the <Link to="/import/beatoraja-ir">LR2oraja IR</Link>, for automatic
				score uploading.

				Note: If you submit a score on a chart that {TachiConfig.NAME} doesn't recognise,
				you'll need to wait until atleast 2 other players submit scores for that chart
				before it'll show up. This is to combat accidental IR spam.
