# Game Configuration

Tachi has two sets of game configurations.

The first is on the game level, which contains things
like the humanised name for the game (i.e. `iidx -> beatmania IIDX`).

The second is for each individual game + playtype
combination, which contains things like the list of
lamps for the game.

	This page is unfinished.

	It would be really appreciated if someone formatted
	the configurations for every game! For the time being,
	the below documentation is just the raw configuration
	for each game. Please see [Contributing to Tachi](../../contributing).

This documentation is unfinished. It is probably easier for you to [just read the config.ts file](https://github.com/zkldi/Tachi/tree/main/common/src/config/config.ts)
