## What is Tachi?

Tachi is a modern, powerful, modular Rhythm Game Score Tracker.

In short, it does the things that people would otherwise make spreadsheets for.

Tachi is a score tracker and analyser for various rhythm games.
It was designed out of a dislike for existing websites that display your scores.
I think that scores are integral to the rhythm game experience, and that displaying them
properly is _just_ as important!

By using Tachi, you get access to powerful, novel rhythm game score-tracking features, like automatically breaking your scores into sessions, setting goals and rivals, and more!

There are way more features that Tachi has, and you can read about all of them [here](https://docs.tachi.ac/wiki/features).

## Setup

Check the [Documentation](https://docs.tachi.ac/contributing/setup) for how to set Tachi up.

You can then check the component-specific guides to see how to run those components and contribute back.

## Repository Info

This monorepo contains the following codebases:

- `client/`, Which is a React frontend for Tachi. (AGPL3)

The client and the server are fairly decoupled. Someone could trivially create their own frontend client for Tachi.

This contains all of our API calls, and interfaces with our database, and powers the actual score import engine.

- `database-seeds/`, Which is a git-tracked set of data to be synced with Tachi. (unlicense)
